            </aside>
            <p>
                I am brand new to the world of Web Development, although I do have vast experience in technology systems management.
                For the last fourteen years I served as the Vice President and General Manager at Main & High Shortstop, which was the convenience
                 store owned by my parents. I, along with my wife, managed twenty-two employees, placed all orders, and managed all inventory. In addition 
                 to those duties, I was also solely in charge of both the upkeep and continued functioning of the point of sale computers, as well as the back 
                 office software that served them.
            </p>
            <p>
                My parents recently retired, and my wife and I decided not to continue on with the business, but instead to forge a new path for ourselves. I 
                enrolled in a Coding BootCamp and have been studying hard to learn all of the material. It has been challenging so far, but I look forward to 
                the future and all that I still have to learn.
