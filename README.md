# Ryan-Givens-Portfolio
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and build a portfolio that I can regularly 
update, and that will eventually serve as my professional portfolio going forward.

Tasks Completed
I endeavored to build my portfolio to be a pretty close recreation of the basic
template that we were given to duplicate. It took a lot of time, and frankly a lot 
messing around, to get it how I wanted it. But, each time I got something to work
felt like a victory and it was overall a postive experience.


Closing
In closing, I feel that my portfolio has been built to specifications and that the 
layout is in line with what I visually enjoy. I is my hope that it meets the standards of 
the viewer as well.
